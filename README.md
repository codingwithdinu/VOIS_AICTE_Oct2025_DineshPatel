AICTE VOIS Internship Project | October 2025

## 📘 Project Overview

This project is developed as part of the AICTE–VOIS Internship Program (Oct 2025) under the DIY Project-4: AIRBNB Hotel Booking Analysis.
The goal of this project is to perform data analysis and visualization on the Airbnb dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to hotel bookings.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze Airbnb booking data to understand key factors influencing reservations.

- Identify booking trends based on location, room type, price, and customer behavior.

- Perform data visualization to represent insights in an interactive and meaningful way.

- Strengthen Python programming and data analytics skills.

## 🧩 Dataset

The dataset is provided by VOIS for Tech and can be downloaded from:
